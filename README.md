# Yoshi's-Challenge
  
  Objective: This game functions much like Chip's Challenge, in that the main objective is to collect "chips" (eggs), which will allow
  the player (as Yoshi) to access the destination (Baby Mario) and win before time runs out. 
  
  Level Layout: There are two levels, with each one providing a unique challenge for the user to overcome. Level 1 is a memory/guessing
  game that is very much a race against the clock, while Level 2 is more tedious and requires both patience and discipline from the
  player.
  
  Controls: Up/Down/Left/Right keys on your keyboard. Buttons need to be clicked on (NOTE: Most buttons don't work until after "Start"
  has been clicked)
  
  Tile/Sprite Overview:
  Yoshi Sprite: The player's sprite
  Baby Mario Sprite: Sprite of the destination, Baby Mario
  Open Tile: Regular Tile that can be walked on
  Wall Tile: Tile that blocks movement under all circumstances
  Grass Tile: Surrounds the outside of the board - serves no real purpose
  Temporary Wall Tile: Red Tile that blocks access to Baby Mario until all eggs are collected
  Egg Sprite: Egg that can be collected by walking on top of it 
  Door Tile: Door that requires a specific key to be opened, at which point it disappears. All doors look the same, but each one
  requires a specific key
  Hint Sprite: Winged cloud with a question mark. Standing on top of this will provide a hint for completing the level.

  NOTES BEFORE/WHILE PLAYING:
  1) Yes, the game does lag, especially on Level 2. It's a part of the authentic gaming experience
  2) Make sure to ONLY click on the START Button while within the game window when you run the game. After that you can click on
  whatever you want.
  3) Level select and most other button functions work only after the START button has been clicked, and you can only change levels
  when in some kind of paused state (Pause, Game Over, etc.)
